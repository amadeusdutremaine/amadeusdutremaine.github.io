      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m Amadeus Dutremaine, a passionate technologist and systems builder with a dual background in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. I specialize in integrating secure systems, analyzing threats, and developing real-time embedded platforms.</p>
      <p>Through hands-on leadership and technical rigor, Iâ€™ve worked on everything from AI-powered phishing detection bots and sonar-enabled marine vehicles to live AV/IT infrastructure for community events. I believe in breaking things ethically to understand them deeply â€” then rebuilding them better, faster, and safer.</p>
      <p>My work is guided by curiosity, resilience, and a drive to empower others through technology. Whether itâ€™s training fellow students in security principles, optimizing sensor systems in autonomous vehicles, or debugging code until sunrise â€” I bring a builderâ€™s heart to a security-first mindset.</p>
      <p>Currently certified in <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> and <strong>Network+</strong>, I am actively exploring new opportunities to protect, connect, and inspire through tech. Please browse my site to learn more about my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, <a href="education.html">education</a>, and professional <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.</p>
