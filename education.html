      <p><strong>Degrees:</strong> Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity</p>
      <p><strong>Minor:</strong> Asian Studies</p>
      <p>This rigorous dual-degree program equipped me with a robust understanding of both software and hardware systems, and their secure integration in modern computing environments. Relevant coursework included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems</li>
        <li>Malware Analysis and Network Security</li>
        <li>Cloud Computing and Virtualization</li>
        <li>Digital Forensics and Incident Response</li>
        <li>Cyber Law, Criminal Justice, and Ethics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Skills developed include penetration testing, system hardening, secure coding, traffic analysis with Wireshark, command-line forensics using Volatility, and microcontroller-based development with C and Assembly. Additionally, the Asian Studies minor enhanced my cross-cultural communication and language literacy, providing a well-rounded global perspective in tech diplomacy and cybersecurity policy.</p>

      <p><strong>Degree:</strong> Associate of Applied Science in Computer Science</p>
      <p>Completed through the prestigious Dual Enrollment Academies program, which enabled me to graduate with a college degree before completing high school. Coursework included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming (Java & Python)</li>
        <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>Assembly Language and Low-Level Programming</li>
        <li>Discrete Mathematics and Logic Design</li>
        <li>Software Development Practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This early foundation solidified my passion for computing and gave me practical skills in coding, logic optimization, and algorithmic thinking that I’ve built upon through advanced studies and professional projects.</p>
